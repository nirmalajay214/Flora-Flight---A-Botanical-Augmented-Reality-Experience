# Flora-Flight---A-Botanical-Augmented-Reality-Experience
`In the era of augmented reality (AR), this project, "Flora & Flight: A Botanical and Interactive Augmented Reality Experience," seeks to deliver an interactive and educational adventure. This project combines cutting-edge AR technologies with captivating dragon interaction and virtual plant growth. Utilizing Niantic Lightship and the Unity engine, this AR application detects real-world surfaces and fills them with virtual flora. Behind the scenes, a C# script manages the detection of real-world surfaces, ensuring accuracy in rendering virtual elements. Additionally, a C# script governs the dragon's controls, utilizing the new input system for an intuitive joystick experience, while an integrated scoring system tallies points as the dragon interacts with these virtual plants. This script-based integration highlights the flexibility of C#, contributing to the immersive and interactive experience of controlling the dragon in "Flora & Flight." This project serves as a valuable educational resource for aspiring developers, offering insights into the integration of AR components and Niantic Lightship using Unity. The methodology involves thorough research, animation, user interaction, and comprehensive testing, providing upcoming developers with practical knowledge for creating compelling AR experiences like "Flora & Flight."
